# semi-OO-hashtable
A semi object oriented hashtable in C (made for Systems Programming class)

NOTE: the structure of the functions is more fragmented than I would prefer, as the auto-grader graded based on complexity.
Complexity is measured by nested conditional code, therefore ite was necessary to break up many functions into smaller blocks.
